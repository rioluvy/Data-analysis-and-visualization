# Data Analysis Practice

This repository contains my practice projects for learning **data analysis**.  
I explored various techniques to **clean, process, and visualize data** using Python libraries such as:

- **NumPy** for numerical computations  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis  
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization  

The goal of this repository is to strengthen my skills in data analysis and build a foundation for more advanced projects.
